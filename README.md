# Lobbyists4America

Lobbyists4America was selected as a client because it is a company that I find interesting to analyze. This is a consulting firm, and it focuses on providing data to its clients about U.S. law. In order for Lobbyists4America to work in a more efficient way, it has ordered an analysis of its data. For this we have the data of the tweets of the US congress from 2008 to 2017. In this period of time you can analyze issues related to decision-making in legislation, the important issues that are discussed and the interrelationships that are carried out within the congress.

#About the data
The data to be analyzed is relevant and we must obtain conclusive results to inform the client. For this purpose, a statistical analysis has been carried out through which relevant information has been obtained from congress and the legislation that has been given in the last nine years through various statistical measures.

# To analyze the data we start with three questions

1.   	Is there a correlation between the number of new laws granted and the interaction with the twitter account?
2.   	Are the most frequently used keywords associated with any legislative process?
3.   	Is there a deviation in the data, for example in the case of the interaction of the Twitter account?

# The hypotheses are as follows:

1.   	Whether there is a correlation between the number of new laws granted and the interaction with the twitter account.
2.   	The most frequented keywords are associated with some legislative process.
3.   	If there is a deviation in the data, for example in the case of the interaction of the Twitter account

# RESULTS

1.   	The correlation between the number of new laws granted and the interaction with the twitter account has a value of 0.21, therefore the correlation is low, that is, there is no relationship between both variables.
2.   	The most frequent keywords with the realization of some legislative process have an average correlation of 0.52, therefore the results are inconclusive and nothing can be asserted.
3.   	There is a standard deviation in the interaction of the data, it has a value of 0.65, so it is presumed that there is an interaction on some specific dates.

# Statistical analysis
Regarding the statistical analysis, the statistical measures obtained to corroborate the hypotheses were two Pearson correlations. In the case of the first hypothesis, the Person correlation obtained a value of 0.21, indicating that the correlation is low, that is, there is no association between the variables. In the case of the second hypothesis, a Pearson correlation was obtained with a value of 0.52, so it is deduced that the correlation is medium, that is, no conclusive result can be asserted. Regarding the standard deviation found in the interaction of the congress Twitter account, it was found with a value of 0.65, which indicates an inequitable distribution in the data. That is, there is interaction on some days more than on others. It was also determined that the regression is linear according to the graph obtained.
